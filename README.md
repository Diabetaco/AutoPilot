# AutoPilot

I began development on this Chrome Entension to gain insight on how to create Chrome Extensions. I Hope that this extension can be helpful to you.

This extension currently removes-
* Course Evaluation Window
* Weekly Digest Course

This extension also gives-
* Dark Mode

In the future I'd like to be able to remove the weekly digest news items, as well as the ability to toggle specific features, but for now this is what I've got.

To Install:
Google Chrome -> Extensions-> Enable Developer Mode -> Load Unpacked -> Select the Auto-Pilot Folder
